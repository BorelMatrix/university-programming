In the record folder, we have three interesting data  
such that changes of the zero_ctr parameter in deflation_  
pwm.m will leads to the accuracy in calculating eig_s  
and eig_v.
It is interesting as if we could reduce the error caused  
by bad matrix condition through changing the zero_ctr  
parameter to proper value.
