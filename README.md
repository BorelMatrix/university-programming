# university-programming  
## background  
This project is started in Wuhan University, more precisely, School of Mathematics and Statistics  
While learning mathematics courses and doing some computer-mathematics researchs (_independently problems solving or just homework assigned by professors_) , we may produce many worth-sharing codes by using softwares such as Matlab and Mathematica.  
## goal  
This project is aiming at communicating our ideas better in writing enjoyable codes.  
**You're welcome to join us!**
## initial files  
There are serval files tagged by _initials_, which come from the code exited in my laptop written in the past half years.
I hope the files uploaded satisfies the goal made in preceding part.
## update plan  
I will try to update these codes once a week.
## expectations  
Necessary notes in your codes is acknowledged.    
If possible, a README file describing your sub-project is appreciated by everyone.
By the way, I will try to adds some README files in some sub-projects in the _initials_ folders mentioned above.
## others 
Leave it blank at this stage.

**Thanks!**
